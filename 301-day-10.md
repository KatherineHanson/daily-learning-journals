# My Learning Journal: Day 10
*********************************************************************
Today we learned functional programming. Despite its processing time efficiency cost, functional programming does seem like a very handy tool to use to DRY up code. I have used some similar functionality in Ruby, so I think I can do the labs for this unit without too much trouble. I think, haha.

The SQL labs wrapped up in the morning. I have found embarrassing bugs in my pair programming lab code while testing -- which, so far, have been fixed by correcting small typos. I need to be more careful about mistakes like that.
