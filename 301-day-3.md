# My Learning Journal: Day 3
*********************************************************************
We are learning delegation and event handlers. Sam was right that the third day of 301 would be especially hard, but I think I'm getting a decent grasp of the material by now. Learning to select data categories and match them to IDs was particularly a brain stretch, but Brandon helped me understand a method I tried using to do that. Katherine P also had a very sound approach and I noted where its functionality was analogous to the functionality of the solution Brandon and I discussed. I'm still getting the hang of traversing the DOM and also compared the Day 3 Lab solution my team turned in with another group's to likewise compare our solutions' logic.
