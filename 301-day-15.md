# My Learning Journal: Day 15
*********************************************************************
For day 15, we did our last day of lab work. As Brandon and Christina know, I had some comical adventures dashing to the closest Cherry St Coffee in an attempt to use the Github API with localhost because too many people were accessing it from the same location, but even there, I was blocked from accessing it despite my github_token.js and and index.html being set up properly. Though I wasn't able to complete the lab that day, I later got confirmation from Brandon that I was on the right track for later work. In the afternoon, I assembled with my Project Week team, and we completed most of the planning for our chosen idea, the show-tracker I suggested on Canvas. Different team members had differing ideas about how to actually implement the idea, but that is normal and we resolved them and ended up with a data model and a user case model that everyone seems happy with. I'm looking forward to beginning implementation on Monday.
