# My Learning Journal: Day 6
*********************************************************************
Today we focused on JSON and AJAX. It was a brain stretch, but not overly so because of our work with localStorage in 201. I am excited about delving more into the backend with this unit. I have not worked with AJAX or JSON before, but am loving JSON's versatility, knowing that I can use it similarly with languages that are not JavaScript. It has also been interesting learning to use Ajax handlers in combination with the logic that we have been using since pre-work.
