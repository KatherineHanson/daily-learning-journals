# My Learning Journal: Day 11
*********************************************************************
Today, we learned SPA routing... or at least routing that brings us closer to implementing a complete SPA, pre-401. I enjoyed implementing routes in lab, and it didn't take too long for my partner Chai and I to implement its TODOs. The biggest hiccup we made was working on routes.js before the aboutController.js or articleController.js, especially since routes.js calls articleView.aboutController(), which is defined in articleController.js. Chai and I will spend a short time refactoring the lab in the morning.
