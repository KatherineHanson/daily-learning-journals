# My Learning Journal: Day 2
*********************************************************************
Today we began exploring the relationship between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and web development architecture. I'm looking forward to exploring MVC architecture more in-depth in Code 301, and actually learning how to build it in Code 401. We also discussed:

- Data types
- Modularity
- Pseudocode

I have used pseudocode before, but think that mine could use some polishing, and look forward to improving it. I also try to implement modularity in my code, but could for *sure* stand to learn that better. We also worked on Git commands and interaction with Github. I have only committed work to Github by creating a project on Github, cloning it on my laptop, and then coding, so learning the create local project/wire up Github/write code process has been interesting.
