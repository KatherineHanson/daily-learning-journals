# My Learning Journal: Day 20
*********************************************************************
All of the hard that my group and I did finally paid off in what seemed to be a successful presentation. Everyone in my group contributed something crucial to it, and I think it came together nicely. Testing the last deployment before my group's mock presentation revealed a bug that initially caused me a lot of stress given the timing, but was ultimately fine because our project was still presentable. (And of course, the fact that I could add the fix after my group's real presentation and the fix passed testing on redeployment helped.) I now feel better equipped to handle similar situations in the future. I was also anxious about doing my self-introduction speech during the presentation - I was worried about coming across as too bland or too something else - but I refined the intro speech I had previously practiced, ran it by people, and recited it out loud, and that helped.
