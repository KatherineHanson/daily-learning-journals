# My Learning Journal: Day 16

We wrapped up our project-plannin and dove into working on our MVP.
We accomplished the following.

- Planning out our algorithm in pseudocode.
- Starting work in creating and rendering game tiles elements.

Kyle was Navigator while the rest of us drove. We examined a lot of other example of jQuery-free JavaScript creating tile puzzles, and think we have a good path towards producing full MVP functionality.
