# My Learning Journal: Day 15
*********************************************************************
We have wrapped up our Code 201 classes and more or less started
Project Week. I am excited about the concepts to be explored in Code
301, especially digging into the guts of the controls and models part
of VCM. My team started our Project Week project-planning work
yesterday. We did not all spend as much time planning together as I
hoped, but we have our project idea chosen and at least some of
the user stories submitted. I have drafted some user cases as a
thought exercise to stimulate ideas about the flow of the site, and
am working on our required/nice-to-have features lists. Here is how
we're organizing:

- Meeting at a coffee shop tomorrow from at least 1-4.
  - Based on my time working on product development at a startup, I don't anticipate that time being enough for what we will need to do then, but plan to work later if need be and am seeing if the team members who cannot only make those hours are willing to stay later. Otherwise, we can maybe work separately later or come into Code Fellows early Monday morning, though being done asap is ideal.
- Slack group.
- Trello board for keeping our non-code documentation organized.
