We have been increasingly diving into the backend. Today we focused on the interaction between databases and the websites they connect to, specifically in the form of PostgreSQL. I didn't have trouble with the TODOs for today's lab, but the comment responses were a little trickier. Thinking through the server.js code aloud line-by-line helped. I have some familiarity with SQL and the homework reading provided a good refresher. I am glad the SQL reading includes code examples one can work through to put the reading into practice.
