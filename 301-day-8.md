# My Learning Journal: Day 8
*********************************************************************
We have been increasingly diving into the backend. Today we focused on the interaction between databases and the websites they connect to, specifically in the form of PostgreSQL. I didn't have trouble with the TODOs for today's lab, but the comment responses were a little trickier. Thinking through the server.js code aloud line-by-line helped. I have some familiarity with SQL and the homework reading provided a good refresher. I am glad the SQL reading includes code examples one can work through to put the reading into practice.

When I did the portfolio lab in the morning, I figured out how much less functionality my portfolio SPA needs than a website with more than one html page, like the pair programming lab blog page. I also got clarification on exactly when I should use const versus let when assigning variables.
