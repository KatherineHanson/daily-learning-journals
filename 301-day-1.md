# My Learning Journal: Day 1
*********************************************************************
Today we discussed MVC, flexible layouts, RWD and mobile design, and viewport tags. The lab today required my pair-programming partner Michelle and I to add a meta tag for viewport to some pre-existing code, and also add a hamburger icon. The meta tag task was a breeze, but we got stuck for a bit figuring out how to call and format the hamburger icon. Now I feel like I have a strong grasp on how to add one to an HTML page. I can also imagine how I would use JavaScript/jQuery to render one. We are also starting our portfolio projects. I have not used Skeleton before, but it seems like a very useful boilerplate and I'm glad I can learn how to wield it.
