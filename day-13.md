# My Learning Journal: Day 13
*********************************************************************
Today we focused on implementing localStorage to save and retrieve the voting data input into our Bus Mall programs. The solution to the data retrieval part of it was deceptively simple. When it came to the else part of the if-else statement I created for data retrieval, I got lost in the weeds a bit and assumed that the code needed for it had more complex logic than it did. I need to be careful not to overcomplicate solutions I consider in the future.
