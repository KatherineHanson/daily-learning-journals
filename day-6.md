# My Learning Journal: Day 6
*********************************************************************
We are now focusing more heavily on JavaScript, specifically object-oriented programming. We have also dipped our toes into the world of testing. I have done some previous OOP with JavaScript, but not for the purposes of manipulating HTML in what could at least theoretically become a full-fledged website before this class, so it's been exciting to start doing that, seeing the changes wrought by my JavaScript objects in my browser. I have some light prior Test-Driven Development experience, but in Ruby, not JavaScript, so it's interesting comparing the two languages when it comes to TDD. I have heard of the TDD vs BDD divide from a dev who prefers BDD, but I do like coding TDD so far.
