# My Learning Journal: Day 17
*********************************************************************
We completed a lot of the functionality of our MVP. The following was added to our project:
- functionality to render all images using canvas.
- functionality to randomize an array holding our tile data then split that data into the number of arrays, or rows, we need.
- event-listening and handling that randomizes the images when the user clicks a New Game button.

Unfortunately, finalizing functionality for tile movement (or lack thereof) when a user clicks a tile gave us too much trouble for us to feel confident about making our MVP deadline, so we opted to switch tracks and make a different game that would still use a decent amount of the functionality we already had. We chose Gaby's excellent game idea and gave it a Brady Bunch theme, as Kyle suggested, and left Code Fellows shortly after with the aim of working on the following functionality.
- Timer: Gaby
- Scores page (html and JS): Kyle
- Image-rendering: Zach (we had a little trouble with the images' container not allowing the user to select an individual image for event-listening/handling)
- Settings (html and JS): Me

We are excited about this idea and think/hope our audience will have fun with it.
