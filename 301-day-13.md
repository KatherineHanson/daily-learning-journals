# My Learning Journal: Day 13
*********************************************************************
Today, we learned about Heroku. I have deployed to it before, but it has been a while and our Heroku learning unit filled some holes in my knowledge. I also learned how to refactor an Ajax call to use the $.get method, gaining a better understanding of how the app Ian and I worked on functions overall. Ian and I were able to knock out the lab by 6 this afternoon, and I don't anticipate having much trouble applying its concepts to my Portfolio.
