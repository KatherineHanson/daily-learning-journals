# My Learning Journal: Day 18
*********************************************************************
Yesterday, my team mostly finished our MVP.
- Gaby: Timer counting down time user can play
- Zach and Kyle: Scores page (with some added styling by Zach)
- Me: image randomization, score-counting, sound settings working on the homepage whether the user changes the settings or not

I haven't worked with audio files before, so it was really interested learning how to manipulate one as we needed, without resorting to onclick. The examples I found online tended to rely on onclick, but I know it's old-fashioned and coded to avoid it.
