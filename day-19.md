# My Learning Journal: Day 19
*********************************************************************
My team and I produced a game that I am pretty proud of. My biggest lesson was to be careful about data types when I store numbers and retrieve them back again -- that caused an issue with storage retrieval in my setting.js code, not my app.js. But manipulating the value returned by storage retrieval on settings.js after passing either the default sound setting or the user's selection into localStorage. ...Ultimately, I did not need this storage retrieval code to remain in my settings.js file, but it helped me pinpoint the data types issue that I needed to resolve to successfully implement the code that persists the user's previous settings selection when the user returns to the Settings page.
