# My Learning Journal: Day 6
*********************************************************************
We are currently focusing on tables, forms, and events. I haven't rendered tables in JavaScript at all before, and have only coded events for forms in Ruby on Rails, so I'm excited about being able to do it in JavaScript now, as well. I'm looking forward to adding jQuery functionality to my website work also, since it looks like it should allow me to add even more nifty functionality very efficiently. Going from what Code Fellows alums have said, the salmon cookies project is infamous and I can see why! But I'm learning a lot, also trying to learn from class and textbook examples how to architect my code without too much redundancy or inefficient architecture.
