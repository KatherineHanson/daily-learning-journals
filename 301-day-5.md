# My Learning Journal: Day 5
*********************************************************************
On Friday, we learned forms. The day's lecture was interesting because it was more workshop-style than usual, as we were told it would be. The trickiest and most interesting part of the lecture was working on preview display, because getting that type of functionality seems harder to implement than just entering post data and rendering it to display on another page. We've also started completed Code Wars kata. I previously completed only 1 solution using Ruby, but have switched to focusing on JavaScript in keeping with the class. I completed 8 solutions and reached 7 kyu before stopping. (Link here: https://www.codewars.com/users/KatherineHanson/completed_solutions) My solutions could definitely be more elegant, but I expect that I will hone them as I continue along.
